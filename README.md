## 💻 Project

BeTheHero is a project that connects people that want to make money contributions to ONG's that need some help. I was made during the 11º Omnistack week presented by RocketSeat. I've learnd a ton about advanced concepts of Reactjs and got in touch with ReactNative using EXPO witch just blew mind showing me that styling and elements positioning is really easy due to FlexBox and other tools that are really similar to Reactjs. It was really fun to make and really challenging as well.
